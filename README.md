### Theory Topics

### Geologic Maps
Geologic maps are a key component of the event. They show the distribution of different rock types and ages, as well as structural features such as faults and folds. The colors on a geologic map represent different rock types, and symbols indicate structural features. For example, strike and dip symbols show the orientation of rock layers. The strike is the direction of the line formed by the intersection of a rock layer with a horizontal plane, while the dip is the angle at which the rock layer inclines from the horizontal plane.

### Topographic Maps
Topographic maps depict the three-dimensional shape of the Earth's surface using contour lines, which are lines of equal elevation. Each contour line represents a specific elevation, and the difference in elevation between contour lines is called the contour interval. Topographic maps are used to identify landforms, calculate gradients, and assess geologic hazards. For instance, closely spaced contour lines indicate steep slopes, while widely spaced contour lines indicate gentle slopes.

### Earth Science Basics
Understanding the basics of Earth science is crucial for the event. This includes knowledge of plate tectonics, rock formation, Earth structure, and Earth history. Plate tectonics refers to the movement of the Earth's lithospheric plates, which can cause earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountains. Rock formation involves the processes that create different types of rocks, including igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. Students should also be familiar with the geologic time scale, which divides Earth's history into different eras based on significant events and changes in the fossil record.

### Geologic Principles
Several key geologic principles help in interpreting rock formations and their history:
- **Superposition:** In a sequence of undisturbed sedimentary layers, the oldest layer is at the bottom, and the layers become progressively younger toward the top.
- **Original Horizontality:** Sedimentary rocks are originally deposited in horizontal layers. If they are found tilted or folded, it means they have been disturbed by tectonic processes.
- **Lateral Continuity:** Sedimentary layers extend laterally in all directions until they thin out or encounter a barrier.
- **Cross-Cutting Relationships:** Geologic features that cut across other features are younger than the features they cut.

### Major Geologic Structures

#### Synclines and Anticlines
- **Synclines:** Downward-curving folds in rock layers, where the youngest rocks are at the core.
- **Anticlines:** Upward-curving folds in rock layers, with the oldest rocks at the core.

### Monoclines
A monocline is a simple bend in rock layers where all layers incline in the same direction. It is typically formed by differential movement in the Earth's crust.

### Domes and Basins
- **Domes:** Circular or elliptical upwarping of rock layers, with beds dipping away from the center. Domes can form due to the intrusion of magma or the bending of Earth's crust.
- **Basins:** Circular or elliptical downwarping of rock layers, with beds dipping toward the center. Basins can form due to subsidence or the weight of overlying sediment.

### Unconformities
Unconformities represent gaps in the geologic record where rock layers have been eroded or not deposited for a period of time. There are several types of unconformities:
- **Nonconformity:** Sedimentary rocks overlying igneous or metamorphic rocks.
- **Angular Unconformity:** Tilted or folded sedimentary rocks that are overlain by younger, more flat-lying layers.
- **Disconformity:** Parallel rock layers with a gap in the geologic record, often indicated by an erosion surface.
- **Paraconformity:** An unconformity with no obvious erosion surface but a gap in the geologic record.

#### Example Problems
- **Three-Point Problem:** Calculating strike and dip using three outcrop points.
- **True Thickness Calculation:** Finding true thickness from map data.
- **Construction Problems:** Drawing topographic profiles, profiling geologic maps, using stereonets.

By honing these skills and understanding these concepts, teams can excel in Geologic Mapping competitions.
